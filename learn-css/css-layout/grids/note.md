GRID

- What is grid layout?
- Creating your grid in CSS
- Defining a grid
- Flexible grids with the fr unit
  - Note: The fr unit distributes available space, not all space. Therefore, if one of your tracks has something large inside it, there will be less free space to share.
- Gaps between tracks
  - column-gap
  - row-gap
  - gap
- Repeating track listings
- The implicit and explicit grid
  - The explicit grid is the one that you create using grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows
